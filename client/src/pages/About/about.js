      <p>
  Hi, I'm Jalen Norris, a software engineer with a focus on full-stack development using JavaScript and Java. My passion lies in creating dynamic web applications, utilizing front-end technologies like React and JavaScript, alongside robust back-end solutions built with Java and Spring Boot. With a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end development, I‚Äôm able to design seamless, scalable solutions that enhance the user experience and drive efficiency. I‚Äôm always exploring new ways to improve my development practices and stay ahead of the latest trends in web development.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my career, I've worked on projects that range from building intuitive user interfaces to designing powerful server-side applications. My experience with JavaScript allows me to create responsive, interactive front-end components, while my knowledge of Java and Spring Boot enables me to develop secure, performant back-end systems. I thrive in environments where I can solve complex technical challenges and contribute to the growth of the products I work on. As I continue to develop my skills, I‚Äôm eager to tackle new projects that combine the best of both front-end and back-end technologies, ultimately building applications that have a real impact on users and businesses.
